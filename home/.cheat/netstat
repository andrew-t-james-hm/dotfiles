# Here are the descriptions of the netstat options used in order to get a list
# of programs and the ports that they are listening on.
# -n show numerical addresses instead of determining symbolic names
# -u include the UDP protocol
# -t include the TCP protocol
# -l show only listening sockets
# -p show the PID and program name

# Find out Which Programs Are Listening on Which Ports
sudo netstat -nutlp

# NOTE: Mac OS X cannot display PIDs. Use one of these instead. Substitute $PORT
# with the port number or a comma-separated list of port number.
sudo lsof -n -i4TCP:$PORT | grep LISTEN
sudo lsof -n -iTCP:$PORT | grep LISTEN
sudo lsof -n -i:$PORT | grep LISTEN
sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep TCP

# To view routing table (use -n flag to disable DNS lookups):
netstat -r

# Which process is listening to port <port>
netstat -pln | grep <port> | awk '{print $NF}'

Example output: 1507/python

# Fast display of ipv4 tcp listening programs
sudo netstat -vtlnp --listening -4

# WARNING ! netstat is deprecated.
# Replace it by:
ss

# For netstat-r
ip route

# For netstat -i
ip -s link

# For netstat-g
ip maddr

# to find out what programs are listening on what ports and addresses and
# if you're cool with that

sudo netstat -lp
