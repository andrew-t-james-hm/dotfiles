# grep searches for lines matching a pattern.

# Search a file for a pattern
grep pattern file

# Case insensitive search (with line numbers)
grep -in pattern file

# Recursively grep for string <pattern> in folder:
grep -R pattern folder

# Read search patterns from a file (one per line)
grep -f pattern_file file

# Find lines NOT containing pattern
grep -v pattern file

# Donâ€™t forget the case insensitivity flag either, since by default grep works
# with fixed case:
grep -iR somevar .

# Also, you can print a list of files that match without printing the matches
# themselves with `grep -l`:
grep -lR someVar .

# If you write scripts or batch jobs using the output of the above, use a while
# loop with read to handle spaces and other special characters in filenames:
grep -lR someVar | while IFS= read -r file; do
  head "$file"
done

# You can grep with regular expressions
grep "^00" file  #Match lines starting with 00
grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" file  #Find IP add

# Find all files which match {pattern} in {directory}
# This will show: "file:line my research"
grep -rnw 'directory' -e "pattern"

# Exclude grep from your grepped output of ps.
# Add [] to the first letter. Ex: sshd -> [s]shd
ps aux | grep '[h]ttpd'

# Colour in red {bash} and keep all other lines
ps aux | grep -E --color 'bash|$'

# Count the number of functions in all JS files
grep -c function *.js

# Print lines that DO NOT have "function"
grep -v function *.js

# List processes that match "pidgin" (non-Windows)
#+ Use [] around the first letter to omit the 'grep' process.
ps -ef | grep [p]idgin

# Print a list of: function <function-name> and sort it
grep -Eho "^\s*function \w+" *.js | sort

# Print filenames, line #s, and lines that start with "(white space)function"
grep -EHn "^\s*(function \w+|\w+ \= function)" *.js

# Print only duplicate function names
grep -hEo "^\s*function \w+" *.js | sort | uniq -d

# Print a List of Files That Contain a given String
grep -rl string .

# Place a filename at the beginning of the line to make it easier to edit the search at the end of the command.
