# Concat columns from files
paste file1 file2 ...

# List the files in the current directory in three columns:
ls | paste - - -

# Combine pairs of lines from a file into single lines:
paste -s -d '\t\n' myfile

# Number the lines in a file, similar to nl(1):
sed = myfile | paste -s -d '\t\n' - -

# Create a colon-separated list of directories named bin,
# suitable for use in the PATH environment variable:
find / -name bin -type d | paste -s -d : -

# Puts lines from two files together, either lines of each file side by side
# (normally separated by a tab-stop but you can have any symbols(s) you like...)
# or it can have words from each file (the first file then the second file) side
# by side.

# To obtain a list of lines side by side, the first lines from the first file on
# the left side separated by a tab-stop then the first lines from the second
# file. You would type:
paste file1.txt file2.txt

# To have the list displayed in serial, first line from first file, [Tab],
# second line from first file, then third and fourth until the end of the first
# file type:
paste --serial file1.txt file2.txt
