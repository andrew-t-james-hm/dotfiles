# We can tell pdfsandwich explicitly about the layout of the page:
pdfsandwich -layout double galton.pdf

# This tells unpaper to search for two separate sub-pages on the page and to
# apply preprocessing procedures to each of them separately.
#
# The layout specification, which is switched off by default, allows the options
# _single_ for each pdf page containing a single scanned page, and _double_. If
# the wrong layout specifications are provided, whole sub-pages might get
# filtered out, or figures might be considered visual noise and disappear. If
# the scan quality is good, it is advisable to completely switch off
# preprocessing by the -nopreproc option. Note that simple deskewing of a
# rotated page (without sub-pages) can be obtained by _convert_, without any
# involvement of unpaper. A useful convert option for this is, for instance:

pdfsandwich -coo "-deskew 40%" scanned_file.pdf

# Both _convert_ and _unpaper_ provide a large number of potentially useful
# preprocessing options which can be specified by -coo and -unpo, respectively.
# You might want to have a look at the [convert online
# manual](<http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php>) or at the man page of
# unpaper.
