# chmod: a Unix utility for managing file permissions

# Add execute for all (myscript.sh)
chmod a+x myscript.sh

# Set user to read/write/execute, group/global to read only (myscript.sh), symbolic mode
chmod u=rwx, go=r myscript.sh

# Remove write from user/group/global (myscript.sh), symbolic mode
chmod a-w myscript.sh

# Remove read/write/execute from user/group/global (myscript.sh), symbolic mode
chmod = myscript.sh

# Set user to read/write and group/global read (myscript.sh), octal notation
chmod 644 myscript.sh

# Set user to read/write/execute and group/global read/execute (myscript.sh), octal notation
chmod 755 myscript.sh

# Set user/group/global to read/write (myscript.sh), octal notation
chmod 666 myscript.sh

# Roles
u - user (owner of the file)
g - group (members of files group)
o - global (all users who are not owner and not part of group)
a - all (all 3 roles above)

# Numeric representations
7 - full (rwx)
6 - read and write (rw-)
5 - read and execute (r-x)
4 - read only (r--)
3 - write and execute (-wx)
2 - write only (-w-)
1 - execute only (--x)
0 - none (---)

# Modes can be expressed in octal or human-readable:

#                       Description | Octal  | Human-readable
# ----------------------------------+--------+---------------
#                    Set user write | 200    | u=w
# Set user rwx, group and others rx | 755    | u=rwx,go=rx
#                    Add group read | -      | g+w
#                Remove all execute | 111    | a-x
#  Set user rws, everyone else none | 4700   | u=rwxs,go-rwx
#                   Add user sticky | -      | u+s
#                  Add group sticky | -      | g+s

# Octal
# --
# Each of these digits is the sum of its component bits. As a result, specific
# bits add to the sum as it is represented by a numeral:
#
# * The read bit adds 4 to its total,
# * The write bit adds 2 to its total,
# * The execute bit adds 1 to its total.
#
# Examples
# --------
#
# "-rwxr-xr-x" would be represented as 755 in three-digit octal.
# "-rw-rw-r--" would be represented as 664 in three-digit octal.
# "-r-x------" would be represented as 500 in three-digit octal.

# Example: Make foo u=rwx and go=rx:
chmod u=rwx,go=rx foo

# Example: Make foo u=rwx and go=rx (in octal):
chmod 755 foo

# Example: Find all subdirectories, put them in 'mygroup', make them group sticky:
find . -type d -exec chgrp mygroup \{\} \;
find . -type d -exec chmod g+s \{\} \;
