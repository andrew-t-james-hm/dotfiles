# List all IPv4 network files
sudo lsof -i4

# List all IPv6 network files
sudo lsof -i6

# To find listening ports:
lsof -Pnl +M -i4

# To find which program is using the port 80:
lsof -i TCP:80

# List all processes accessing a particular file/directory
lsof </path/to/file>

# List all files open for a particular user
lsof -u <username>

# List all files/network connections a given process is using
lsof -c <command-name>

# See this primer: http://www.danielmiessler.com/study/lsof/
# for a number of other useful lsof tips

# Show all connections
lsof -i

# Show only TCP connections (works the same for UDP)
lsof -iTCP

# -i :port shows all networking related to a given port
lsof -i :22

# To show connections to a specific host, use @host
lsof -i@192.168.1.5

# Show connections based on the host and the port using @host:port
lsof -i@192.168.1.5:22

# Grepping for "LISTEN" shows what ports your system is waiting for connections on
lsof -i| grep LISTEN

# Grepping for "ESTABLISHED" shows current active connections
lsof -i| grep ESTABLISHED

# Show what a given user has open using -u
lsof -u ecable

# See what files and network connections a command is using with -c
lsof -c syslog-ng

# Pointing to a file shows what's interacting with that file
lsof /var/log/messages

# The -p switch lets you see what a given process ID has open, which is good for learning more about unknown processes
lsof -p 10075

# The -t option returns just a PID
lsof -t -c Mail

# Using-a allows you to combine search terms, so the query below says, "show me everything running as daniel connected to 1.1.1.1"
lsof -a -u ecable -i @1.1.1.1

# Using the -t and -c options together you can HUP processes
kill -HUP `lsof -t -c sshd`

# You can also use the -t with -u to kill everything a user has open
kill -9 `lsof -t -u daniel`

# lsof +L1 shows you all open files that have a link count less than 1, often indicative of a cracker trying to hide something
lsof +L1

# Show Open Network Connections
sudo lsof -Pni
