You're not going to come up with a simple design through any kind of coding techniques or any kind of programming language concepts. Simplicity has to be achieved above the code level before you get to the point which you worry about how you actually implement this thing in code. - Leslie Lamport
%
UML - I know next to nothing about UML - but what I do know is the language was invented first and then people came around and tried to give semantics to the language. Well, in other words what that means is that the language was invented first and it really didn't mean anything. And then, later on, people came around to try to figure out what it meant. Well, that's not the way to design a specification language. The importance of a specification language is to specify something precisely, and therefore what you write - the specification you write - has to have a precise, rigorous meaning. - Leslie Lamport
%
UML: a language that was invented first and then people came around to try to get semantics. - Leslie Lamport
%
UML: fuzzy pictures of boxes and arrows. - Leslie Lamport
%
People use UML, things like UML, to model programs, but it's not clear how to translate them in to sequences of states, for concurrency. If you cannot translate them in to sequences of states, it means you don't understand them, and it may mean that there's nothing there. You know, there are lots of people selling snake-oil, drawing boxes and arrows that make you feel good, but ultimately have no real meaning. If something is really meaningful you should be able to express it in mathematics. - Leslie Lamport
%
The benefit of using [a formal specification language] is that it teaches you to think rigorously, to think precisely, and the important point is the precise thinking. So what you need to avoid at all costs is any language that's all syntax and no semantics. - Leslie Lamport
%
A lot of the problems that exist in software, a lot of the problems that one encounters in writing... in building a system, in writing a program: those are problems that are caused by not thinking about what you are doing before starting to code. - Leslie Lamport
%
If you're building a complicated system, the battle is won or lost before a single piece of code is written. - Leslie Lamport
%
You're not going to find the best algorithm in terms of computational complexity by coding. - Leslie Lamport
%
You could decide that you want to do something - the what - and then when it comes to programming it you discover that you can't - that is, you don't know how or the how is too expensive or something like that. So I don't mean to imply that what you should first do is thinking completely abstractly about what something is supposed to do and then, only then do you think about how you do it. Part of engineering is understanding what you can do in practice and what you can't. But, given that caveat, you really should understand what the system is doing before you try to implement it. - Leslie Lamport
%
There are two separate things you want to specify about a program or a system: what it does, and how it should do it. - Leslie Lamport
%
It's really important to understand what something is supposed to do before you start to do it. Very often, once you've decided precisely what something is supposed to do, implementing it - the coding, the how - is quite trivial, and it hardly needs a specification at all or might be so simple that you really can just start coding without writing any precise description of how it does it, beyond the specification of what it's supposed to do. - Leslie Lamport
%
First of all, there are lots of different things that can go by the name of specification. I use all of them. Sometimes a specification I write is a few English sentences. Sometimes, it's a very complicated mathematical description of the object, the what or the how. Which one is appropriate depends on the problem: how hard the problem is, how important it is that it get done correctly, and various things like that. - Leslie Lamport
%
Anything you do is an iterative process. You start out by thinking about something, and then you start writing it, and in the course of writing it, you rewrite and you rewrite and you rewrite. - Leslie Lamport
%
A lot of programs I write just for my own use and I can live with the bugs and it's not that important that they be absolutely correct, but sometimes I write code for other people to use and I really want it to work right. - Leslie Lamport
%
The important thing is not the syntax of what you're writing: the important thing is the precision, the rigor. In order to understand things, you have to write them precisely. I use mathematics because that is precise. - Leslie Lamport
%
People who are programmers should be able to think precisely. - Leslie Lamport
%
What you need to avoid at all costs is any language that's all syntax and no semantics, because that is not going to get you to think rigorously - that's going to get you to fool yourself in to thinking that you're thinking. - Leslie Lamport
%
My basic mode of thinking hasn't changed: basically the idea that I want to understand things, and understand things for me means being able to describe them mathematically. - Leslie Lamport

To think, you have to write. If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking. - Leslie Lamport

Writing requires thinking. - Leslie Lamport

There are two models of reality that I find to be the most useful ones, especially when writing programs. The first is functions, and the second is sequences of states. - Leslie Lamport

All possible successor states of any state. - Leslie Lamport

Not knowing what a program should do means we have to think even harder, before we start coding. - Leslie Lamport
%
You write a spec to help you think about a problem before you write the code. - Leslie Lamport
%
People are so used to thinking at a code level that they can't think at a higher level. - Leslie Lamport
%
Why don't programmers write specs? Writing is like running. The less you do it, the slower you are. You have to strengthen your writing muscles. It takes practice. It's easier to find an excuse not to. - Leslie Lamport
%
Thinking doesn't guarantee that you won't make mistakes. Not thinking guarantees that you will. - Leslie Lamport

The right way to think about distributed systems, and I've been doing it for 40 years, is in terms of the state of the system. - Leslie Lamport
%
To the extent that [Agile software development] is [an excuse for not thinking], it's a bad thing. - Leslie Lamport
%
The essence of computing is discreteness, and I believe that what one will discover is that the essence of perception is discretizing something. That is, perception means receiving this continuous input from the environment and making a discrete categorization of it, and that's the point at which perception happens. - Leslie Lamport
%
Generally it doesn't seem to be necessary to deal with Byzantine failures. Using simple techniques like checksums to avoid corruption of data, it's generally felt that that kind of malicious behavior, outside of - where the malice is caused by failure not by hackers - you don't need Byzantine fault tolerance. So, in practice that means if the computers that you're building your system out of are under your control and not under hackers' control then you don't need Byzantine fault tolerance, in which case Paxos is basically the algorithm you should be using. There are different consensus algorithms that have been proposed but the ones that are practical in the sense that they're efficient are all equivalent to Paxos at least in the normal case, and Paxos works: use that. I mean it doesn't solve all your problems, because you still have the problem of optimizing: there are lots of optimization games you can play depending upon the particular nature of the state machine you're trying to implement, but if you understand the basic Paxos algorithm then you'll understand what optimizations can be made to get it to work well for your system. - Leslie Lamport
%
If you're not writing a program, you shouldn't use a programming language, because programming languages are really complicated. They get more and more complicated. Now, they're complicated for good reason: they've got a difficult problem to solve, which is to be able to generate efficient code for these complicated machines, but there's a lot simpler way to describe systems, algorithms, whatever, and y'know it's a language that's been developed for a couple of thousand years for saying things precisely. It's mathematics. - Leslie Lamport
%
Computation is not just about functions. If computation were about functions then quicksort and bubble-sort were the same because they're computing the same function. As I said a computing device is something that goes through a sequence of states and what an assignment statement is doing is it is telling you here is a new state, and also there's the notion of it's non-determinism, so the new state is not a function of the old state. So functional programming in a sense - functions - don't solve the problem of programming. - Leslie Lamport
%
The mathematics of computing - things like sets and functions and logic - are to computing what real numbers are to physics. People who are writing programs should be as facile with that kind of very simple math as physicists are with numbers. - Leslie Lamport

We are all children. But if we cannot be wise, we can at least be honest. I accept the existence of what I call the all-pervading intelligence of the universe. The Orientals call it the Tao.

What can we do as a profession? First of all, acknowledge that our view of the benefits of finance is inflated. While there is no doubt that a developed economy needs a sophisticated financial sector, at the current state of knowledge there is no theoretical reason or empirical evidence to support the notion that all the growth of the financial sector in the last forty years has been beneficial to society. In fact, we have both theoretical reasons and empirical evidence to claim that a component has been pure rent seeking. By defending all forms of finance, by being unwilling to separate the wheat from the chaff, we have lost credibility in defending the real contribution of finance. - Luigi Zingales, 'Does Finance Benefit Society?' 2015 American Finance Association Presidential Address.

All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature. - 'The Communist Manifesto', Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (1848)

On the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Even if you were willing to pay to read them yourself, you can’t link to them. They're not part of the conversation. - Paul Graham (2005)

CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem): it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it was successful or failed) and Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system) - Eric Brewer, Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC) (2000)
%
CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem) - Clarification 1: Because Partitions are rare, there is little reason to forfeit Consistency or Availability when the system is not partitioned. - Eric Brewer, IEEE Computer Society 'Computer' Magazine (2012)
%
CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem) - Clarification 2: The choice between Consistency and Availability can occur many times within the same system at very fine granularity; not only can subsystems make different choices, but the choice can change according to the operation or even the specific data or user involved. - Eric Brewer, IEEE Computer Society 'Computer' Magazine (2012)
%
CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem) - Clarification 3: All three properties (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) are more continuous than binary. Availability is obviously continuous from 0 to 100 percent, but there are also many levels of Consistency, and even Partitions have nuances, including disagreement within the system about whether a Partition exists. - Eric Brewer, IEEE Computer Society 'Computer' Magazine (2012)

It used to be the case that people were admonished to "not re-invent the wheel". We now live in an age that spends a lot of time "reinventing the flat tire!" The flat tires come from the reinventors often not being in the same league as the original inventors. This is a symptom of a "pop culture" where identity and participation are much more important than progress... - Alan Kay (2016)

In the US we are now embedded in a pop culture that has progressed far enough to seriously hurt places that hold "developed cultures".

You could 'hot-edit' Lisp (1.85 at BBN) in the 60s (and there were other such systems). Smalltalk at Parc in the 70s used many of these ideas, and went even further. Development environments should help programmers think (but what if most programmers don't want to think?) - Alan Kay (2016)

When the first Turing Award winner - Al Perlis - was asked in the 60s "What is Computer Science?", he said "It is the science of processes!". He meant all processes including those on computers, but also in Biology, society, etc. His idea was that computing formed a wonderful facility for making better models of pretty much everything, especially dynamic things (which everything actually is), and that it was also the kind of thing that could really be understood much better by using it to make models of itself. Today, we could still take this as a starting place for "getting 'Computer Science' back from where it was banished". - Alan Kay (2016)

The question you are asking is really a societal one - and about operations that are like strip mining and waste dumping. "Hunters and gatherers" (our genetic heritage) find fertile valleys, strip them dry and move on (this only works on a very small scale). "Civilization" is partly about learning how to overcome our dangerous atavistic tendencies through education and planning.

 One of several major mistakes with the web has to do with thinking that the browser is some kind of application "with features" - if you think of the actual scale of the Internet (and they didn't) you realize that at the very least, the browser, etc, has to be more like an operating system, and with as few features as possible: really to safely run encapsulated modules and deal out resources.

Advice to CS students: Learn a lot of other things, and at least one real science and one real engineering. This will help to calibrate the somewhat odd lore aka "computing knowledge".

There's coming up with ideas: learn to dream while you are awake, the ideas are there. There's coming up with a good idea: learn how to not get buried in your ideas (most are mediocre down to bad even for people who have "good idea skills"!) I write down ideas in notebooks to get rid of them. Every once in a while one will capture a different point of view. And, there's the Princeton Tea joke of scientists comparing what they did for ideas. One says "I have them in the middle of the night so I have a pad by my bed". Another says "I have them in the shower so I have a grease pencil to write them on the walls". Einstein was listening and they asked him about his ideas. He said "I don't know, I've only had two!" (Some people are better at filtering than others ...) - Alan Kay (2016)

Most of my ideas come in "waking dreams" (this is a state that most children indulge in readily, but it can be retained in a more or less useful way - I don't think you quite get into adulthood by retaining it, so it's a tradeoff). Main thing about ideas is that, however they come, most of them are mediocre down to bad - so steps have to be taken to deal with this major problem. - Alan Kay (2016)

10 years is too close - 30 years out will generally lose the pernicious connection to the present and "how do we get there?". The idea is to "go out there and bring the ideas back" rather than try to go from the present to the future. - Alan Kay (2016)

Our most unrealistic assumption was that when presented with really good ideas most people will most definitely learn and use them to make progress. In reality, only a tiny percentage can do this, and it is an enormous amount of work to deal with the norms. - Alan Kay (2016)

The problems with most arguments is that they arguers assume they are in a valid context (this is usually not the case, and this is the central problem of "being rational"). Another way to look at it is "Forget about trying to win an argument - use argumentation to try to understand the issues better and from more perspectives ..." - Alan Kay (2016)
%
A good heuristic for designing programming languages is to try to take the largest most complicated kinds of things you want to do, work them out, and then see if there is a "language lurking". Most people make the big mistake of lovingly making small neat examples that are easy to learn - these often don't scale at all well. E.g. "data" in the small "seems natural" but the whole idea scales terribly. And so forth for most of the favorite paradigms around today. - Alan Kay (2016)

Try to avoid "growing old"! A big problem with the general industry is the lack of subsidized "sabbatical years" - these are a good way to recharge and re-orient. Xerox, amazingly, used to have them for employees. But I haven't heard of any such thing recently. If you think about life as needing "renewables" then you shouldn't allow yourself to be "stripmined" (easier said than done). - Alan Kay (2016)

Thomas Edison was already famous for his telegraph technology and his huge hit with the record player. He had made a public show of turning the full focus of his massive laboratory to the question of electric light.

We are at the end of a five-thousand-year-plus historical process during which human society grew in scale while it abandoned the early indigenous wisdom councils and communal decision-making. Power was centralised in the hands of increasingly specialised 'elites' and 'experts' who not only failed to achieve all they promised but used secrecy and the control of information to deceive the public into allowing them to retain power over community resources that they ultimately looted. - Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'

The preconditions of revolution exist in the UK, and most western countries. The number of active pre-conditions is quite stunning, from elite isolation to concentrated wealth to inadequate socialisation and education, to concentrated land holdings to loss of authority to repression of new technologies especially in relation to energy, to the atrophy of the public sector and spread of corruption, to media dishonesty, to mass unemployment of young men and on and on and on. [...] Preconditions are not the same as precipitants. We are waiting for our Tunisian fruit seller. The public will endure great repression, especially when most media outlets and schools are actively aiding the repressive meme of 'you are helpless, this is the order of things.' When we have a scandal so powerful that it cannot be ignored by the average Briton or American, we will have a revolution that overturns the corrupt political systems in both countries, and perhaps puts many banks out of business. Vaclav Havel calls this 'The Power of the Powerless.' One spark, one massive fire. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

The west has pursued an industrialisation path that allows for the privatisation of wealth from the commons, along with the criminalisation of commons rights of the public, as well as the externalisation of all true costs. Never mind that fracking produces earthquakes and poisons aquifers – corrupt politicians at local, state or province, and national levels are all too happy to take money for looking the other way. Our entire commercial, diplomatic, and informational systems are now cancerous. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

When trade treaties have secret sections - or are entirely secret - one can be certain the public is being screwed and the secrecy is an attempt to avoid accountability. Secrecy enables corruption. So also does an inattentive public enable corruption. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

Predatory capitalism is based on the privatisation of profit and the externalisation of cost. It is an extension of the fencing of the commons, of enclosures, along with the criminalisation of prior common customs and rights. What we need is a system that fully accounts for all costs. Whether we call that capitalism or not is irrelevant to me. But doing so would fundamentally transform the dynamic of present day capitalism, by making capital open source. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

We have over 5 billion human brains that are the one infinite resource available to us going forward.

Open source everything is about the five billion poor coming together to reclaim their collective wealth and mobilise it to transform their lives.

Truth does change, both in the mind of man and in the larger reality where man resides. On the one hand, advancing knowledge and paradigm shifts can render old truths sadly insufficient, while bringing forward new, more robust truths.

E Veritate Potens: From Truth, We (the People) Are Made Powerful - Winston Maike, Australian philosopher and researcher, as quoted by Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'
%
Wealth creates a leisure class that 'buys' knowledge and defines irrational authority, thus destroying the ethical basis of civilization. Durant discussed how a civilization may be characterized by its conception of virtue, which led me to some fruitful exploration of how the United States is a culture that has equated wealth with virtue, leading to a political culture that can be bought because it is based on rule by secrecy, using secrecy to avoid accountability. Today, having abdicated concepts of the good, the beautiful, and the true for a model of primitive accumulation and a materialist set of values, we find that our financial system is what journalist Matt Taibbi called 'Griftopia'. The financial interests of Wall Street leverage the two-party system as a theatrical sideshow that legitimizes and legalizes massive fraud against the public interest. This is the primary reason why secrecy is necessary for those in power. - Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'

Sin #1 - Unnecessary distributed parallelism: It does not always make sense to parallelize a computation. Doing so almost inevitably comes with an additional overhead, both in runtime performance and in engineering time. When designing a parallel implementation, its performance should always be compared to an optimized serial implementation in order to understand the overheads involved. If we satisfy ourselves that parallel processing is necessary, it is also worth considering whether distribution over multiple machines is required. The rapid increase in RAM and CPU cores can make local parallelism economical and worthwhile. Establish the need for distributed parallelism on a case by case basis. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #2 - Assuming performance homogeneity: Virtualized cloud environments exhibit highly variable and sometimes unpredictable performance. Base reported results on multiple benchmark runs, and report the variance. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)

%
Sin #4 - Forcing the abstraction: In some application domains, it is unclear if a MapReduce-like approach can offer any benefits, and indeed, some have argued that it is fruitless as a research direction. Ideally, future research should build on [iterative processing, stream processing and graph processing], rather than on the MapReduce paradigm. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #5 - Unrepresentative workloads: The common assumption in academic research systems is that the cluster workload is relatively homogenous. Most research evaluations measure performance by running a single job on an otherwise idle cluster. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #6 - Assuming perfect elasticity: The cloud paradigm [...] its promise of an unlimited supply of computation. This is, of course, a fallacy. Workloads do not exhibit infinite parallel speedup. The scalability and supply of compute resources are not infinite. There are limits to the scalability of data center communication infrastructure. Another reason for diminishing returns from parallelization is the increasing likelihood of failures and vulnerability to "straggler" tasks.  - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #7 - Ignoring fault tolerance: Many recent systems neglect to account for the performance implications of fault tolerance, or indeed of faults occuring. For each system, we should ask whether fault tolerance is relevant or required. If it is, it makes sense to check precisely what level is required, and what faults are to be protected against; consider and ideally quantify the cost. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
