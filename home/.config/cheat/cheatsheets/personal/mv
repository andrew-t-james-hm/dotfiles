### Quickly Change a File's Extension
mv file{.old,.new}

# You can use brace expansion to quickly create a backup copy of a file. Brace
# expansion allows you to create multiple command line arguments from a single
# argument. The single argument is combined with all the strings that are given
# within the braces and creates as many new arguments as brace strings. Values
# in the braces can either be comma separated strings or a sequence expression.
# Examples of sequence expressions include {1..5} and {a..z}.

# To rename a file with a new extension employ brace expansion. This example
# changes a ".txt" file to a ".doc" file.

ls report
# report.txt

mv report.{txt,doc}
# ls report
#    report.doc
