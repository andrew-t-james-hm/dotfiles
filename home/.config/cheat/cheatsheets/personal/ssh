# To ssh via pem file (which normally needs 0600 permissions):
ssh -i /path/to/file.pem user@example.com

# To connect on an non-standard port:
ssh -p 2222 user@example.com

# To connect and forward the authentication agent
ssh -A user@example.com

# To execute a command on a remote server:
ssh -t user@example.com 'the-remote-command'

# To tunnel an x session over SSH:
ssh -X user@example.com

# Redirect traffic with a tunnel between local host (port 8080) and a remote
# host (remote.example.com:5000) through a proxy (personal.server.com):
ssh -f -L 8080:remote.example.com:5000 user@personal.server.com -N

# To launch a specific x application over SSH:
ssh -X -t user@example.com 'chromium-browser'

# To create a SOCKS proxy on localhost and port 9999
ssh -D 9999 user@example.com

# -X use an xsession, -C compress data, "-c blowfish" use the encryption blowfish
ssh user@example.com -C -c blowfish -X

# Copy files and folders through ssh from remote host to pwd with tar.gz compression
# when there is no rsync command available
ssh user@example.com "cd /var/www/Shared/; tar zcf - asset1 asset2" | tar zxf -

# Authenticating via key pair (password-less)

# create the key pair, and authorize clients key with server
ssh-keygen (ALWAYS give a strong password)
ssh user@server 'mkdir ~/.ssh; touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
ssh user@server 'chmod a=,u=Xrw -R ~/.ssh'
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@server 'cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

# After that, you should be able to login to server using the password that you
# used to encrypt your private key. If you password protected your private key
# (strongly recommended), then you should run ssh-agent within your session, and
# then add the key to the agent:

# see if ssh-agent is running (some systems start it up by default)
ps `echo $SSH_AGENT_PID`

# if ssh-agent is not running
eval `ssh-agent`

# or find a way to run it when your login session starts add your key to the agent
ssh-add

# After that, you should not need to type the password again during this session.

# SSH Tunnel

ssh -f -N -L localport:destination:destport user@remotehost
