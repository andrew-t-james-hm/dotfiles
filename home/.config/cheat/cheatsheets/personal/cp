# To copy a file:
cp ~/Desktop/foo.txt ~/Downloads/foo.txt

# To copy a directory:
cp -r ~/Desktop/cruise_pics/ ~/Pictures/

# To create a copy but ask to overwrite if the destination file already exists:
cp -i ~/Desktop/foo.txt ~/Documents/foo.txt

# To create a backup file with date:
cp foo.txt{,."$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"}

# To quickly make a backup of a file:
cp file{,.bak}

# You can use brace expansion to quickly create a backup copy of a file. Brace
# expansion allows you to create multiple command line arguments from a single
# argument. The single argument is combined with all the strings that are given
# within the braces and creates as many new arguments as brace strings. Values
# in the braces can either be comma separated strings or a sequence expression.
# Examples of sequence expressions include {1..5} and {a..z}.

sudo cp /etc/passwd{,.bak}
# ls /etc/passwd
#    /etc/passwd /etc/passwd.bak

mkdir -p ~/my-app/{bin,lib,log}
# ls ~/my-app/
#    bin lib log

echo 10.0.0.{0..7}
# 10.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3 10.0.0.4 10.0.0.5 10.0.0.6 10.0.0.7

# Using expansion to move a file aside without having to type the file name
# twice
cp ReallyLongFileNameYouDontWantToTypeTwice{,.orig}
