# Use the column command to format text into multiple columns. By using the -t
# option, column will count the number of columns the input contains and create
# a table with that number of columns. This can really make the output of many
# command easier to read. I find myself using this so often that I created an
# alias for the command.

# alias ct='column -t

echo -e 'one two\nthree four' | ct

# one   two
# three four

mount -t ext4 | ct

# /dev/vda2 on /     type ext4 (rw)
# /dev/vda1 on /boot type ext4 (rw)
