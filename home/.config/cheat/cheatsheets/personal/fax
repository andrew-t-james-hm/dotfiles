# I had this problem too and it was killing me. To top it off, Adobe Acrobat,
# would not allow me to print and save as a pdf. In Preview you can print and
# save as a pdf which basically gives you a read only view of the pdf, which
# I like to send people. So what I ended up doing was using Adobe Acrobat to save
# as PNG's. Then with a little imagemagick I converted the png's into pdfs.

for i in *.png; do convert "${i}" "${i}.pdf"; done

# Now I had x amount of pdf files, one for each page. I needed to merge them back
# again. At first I tried using imagemagick to do this, but the results were less
# that stellar.

final="";for i in *.pdf; do final="$final ${i}"; done; convert "${final}" my-final.pdf

# Reading superuser gave me a solution. From the
# http://superuser.com/questions/54041/how-to-merge-pdfs-using-imagemagick-resolut
# ion-problem post I came up with the following that worked great.

final="";for i in *.pdf; do final="$final ${i}"; done; pdftk $final cat output my-final.pdf

# Yeah, its a bit lengthy of a process but you know what, it works and I'm okay
# with the command line so, its a solution if you're a risk taker
