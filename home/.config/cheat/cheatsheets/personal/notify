# Some quick & dirty notifications:

$ cmd; say "Don't care how it finished, but it did"
$ cmd && say "Success!"
$ (cmd && say "Success") || say "Failed"

# Example:
$ mysql app_dev < dump.sql && say "Finished importing"

# Quicksilver:
$ cmd; osascript -e 'tell application "Quicksilver" to show large type "Finished!"'

# Growl:
$ cmd; growlnotify -s -m "Done"

# Note: If you are using Leopard, there's a bug with growlnotify as of version
# 1.1.2 that prevents growlnotify from working consistently. However, there's an
# easy workaround.
#
# - Open up the Growl preference pane and select the Network tab.
# - Click to enable "Listen for incoming notifications".
# - Now when you run growlnotify, add the "-H localhost" option.
$ cmd && growlnotify -s -H localhost -m "Success"

# Dbus:
# - The -i and -a flags can be omitted if unneeded.
# - To send a desktop notification via dbus:
$ notify-send -i 'icon-file/name' -a 'application_name' 'summary' 'body of message'
