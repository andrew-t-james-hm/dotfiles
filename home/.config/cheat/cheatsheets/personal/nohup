# Normally when you start a job in the background and log out of your session
# the job gets killed. One way to ensure a command keeps running after you
# disconnect from the host is to use the nohup command. No hup stands for no
# hang up. By default the output of the command is stored in a file named
# "nohup.out" in the directory the program was launched in. You can examine the
# contents of this file later to see the output of the command. To use a
# different filename, employ redirection.

# Run a Command Immune to Hangups, Allowing the Job to Run after You Disconnect
