  # this is the storage half of the 'metadata' system:
  # we create dynamic metadata keywords with function wrappers around
  # the NOP command, ':'

  # anything following a keyword will get parsed as a positional
  # parameter, but stay resident in the ENV. As opposed to shell
  # comments, '#', which do not get parsed and are not available
  # at runtime.

  # a BIG caveat--your metadata must be roughly parsable: do not use
  # contractions, and consider single or double quoting if it contains
  # non-alphanumeric characters
