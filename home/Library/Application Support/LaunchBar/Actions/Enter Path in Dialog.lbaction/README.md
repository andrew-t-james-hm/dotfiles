# Send Location to Dialog

As the name says. It sets the foremost Open/Save cocoa/carbon dialog to the folder
selected in LaunchBar. If no input is given, it will take the folder of the foremost
Finder window. The credit for the script goes to achabotl for [his
applescript](https://github.com/achabotl/Applescripts/blob/master/Launchbar/Enter%20Path.applescript).

__WARNING: The script can be finicky sometimes. It simply switches over to the foremost
application window and hopes it has an open/save dialog open, press cmd+shift+g and
types in the location.

There's no way (that I know of) to test if that window is actually an open/save
dialog.__

Also: sending files to it may mess it up. Your mileage may vary.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!
