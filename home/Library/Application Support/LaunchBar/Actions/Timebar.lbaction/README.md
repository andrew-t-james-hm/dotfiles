# Set TimeBar

Controls [TimeBar.app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timebar/id617829225). It attaches
itself to the TimeBar.app, so you can select it in LaunchBar and press space to invoke
this action.

Feed it a time string and message, like so:

* 30s Flee from Godzilla
* 5 minutes - Walk the dog
* 21d Kill Wanda's lover
* 1hr 30m - Ruminate on life's meaning
* 2hr 25s - Go back in time
* 5s What are you doing with your life?

*(The delimiter isn't necessary)*

Other commands are autocompleted as you type, such as "stop" and "version".


## Credit

* I didn't write the TimeBar CLI included
