# Copy this file here: ~/.tmuxinator/functional.yml
# Invoke with
#   mux functional
# Then hit 'Ctrl-a d' to detach
# Then run 'tmux -CC attach'
# Make sure that option for iterm2 is General --> tmux --> When attaching, open unrecognized windows in Tabs
# Also, check option "Automatically hide the tmux client session after connecting"
# tmux kill-session -t functional

name: functional
root: /usr/local/src/functional

# Runs before everything. Use it to start daemons etc.
# pre: sudo /etc/rc.d/mysqld start

# Runs in each window and pane before window/pane specific commands. Useful for setting up interpreter versions.
# pre_window: rbenv shell 2.0.0-p247
# pre_window: cd /usr/local/src/functional

# Pass command line options to tmux. Useful for specifying a different tmux.conf.
# tmux_options: -f ~/.tmux.mac.conf

# Change the command to call tmux.  This can be used by derivatives/wrappers like byobu.
# tmux_command: byobu

#The following layouts are supported:

    #even-horizontal
            #Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

    #even-vertical
            #Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

    #main-horizontal
            #A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the
            #remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover
            #space at the bottom.  Use the main-pane-height window option to
            #specify the height of the top pane.

    #main-vertical
            #Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on the
            #left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right.
            #See the main-pane-width window option.

    #tiled   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in
            #both rows and columns.
